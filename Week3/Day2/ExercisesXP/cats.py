# Step 1: Create the Siamese Class
#
#     Create a class called Siamese that inherits from the Cat class.
#     You can add any specific attributes or methods for the Siamese breed, or leave it as is if there are no unique behaviors.
#
#
# Step 2: Create a List of Cat Instances
#
#     Create a list called all_cats that contains instances of Bengal, Chartreux, and Siamese cats.
#     Example: all_cats = [bengal_obj, chartreux_obj, siamese_obj]
#     Give each cat a name and age.
#
#
# Step 3: Create a Pets Instance
#
#     Create an instance of the Pets class called sara_pets, passing the all_cats list as an argument.
#
#
# Step 4: Take Cats for a Walk
#
#     Call the walk() method on the sara_pets instance.
#     This should print the result of calling the walk() method on each cat in the list.

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
