suggestions for improvement:
- The code could include docstrings to further enhance readability and explain the purpose of each class and method.
- Consider adding more descriptive names to variables and classes for better understanding.  For example, `all_cats` could be `my_cats`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `run_speed` calculation could be made more robust by adding a check for division by zero if age is 0.  This would prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`. 
- Consider adding docstrings to the class and its methods to improve readability and understanding.
- The fight method could be improved by handling ties more gracefully, perhaps by returning a message like "The fight was a tie!".

suggestions for improvement:
- In the `check_majority` method, consider adding a more informative message when the person isn't found.
- Improve the error message in `check_majority` to be more user friendly. For example, 'Sorry, we couldn't find {first_name} in the family.'
- Add input validation to prevent issues with negative ages or non-string names.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `play` method should handle the case where no other dogs are passed as arguments.  Currently, it will error if `args` is empty. Add a check to handle this case, perhaps returning a message like '<dog_name> plays alone'.
- The `do_a_trick` method uses `randint` which can technically be less efficient than `randrange` for simple integer selection, though the difference is negligible for this small list.  `randrange(0,len(tricks))` is arguably more readable.
- Add docstrings to all methods in the `PetDog` class explaining their functionality, parameters, and return values.  This significantly improves readability and understanding.
