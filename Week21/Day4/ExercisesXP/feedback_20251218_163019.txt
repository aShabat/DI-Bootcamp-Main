suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `Employee` class has a typo: `consturctor` should be `constructor`. Also, the `salary` property should be of type `number`, not `string`. You also need to implement the getEmployeeInfo method.
- In Exercise 3, initialize the `name` property of the `Animal` class, either in the constructor or directly.
- It is good to include all the asked functionality, even if the compiler shows an error as asked in instructions.
Correctness: 80%
