# Part I: Analyzing a Simple String
#
# Step 1: Create the Text Class
#
#     Create a class called Text.
#     The __init__ method should take a string as an argument and store it in an attribute (e.g., self.text).
#
#
# Step 2: Implement word_frequency Method
#
#     Create a method called word_frequency(word).
#     Split the text attribute into a list of words.
#     Count the occurrences of the given word in the list.
#     Return the count.
#     If the word is not found, return None or a meaningful message.
#
#
# Step 3: Implement most_common_word Method
#
#     Create a method called most_common_word().
#     Split the text into a list of words.
#     Use a dictionary to store word frequencies.
#     Find the word with the highest frequency.
#     Return the most common word.
#
#
# Step 4: Implement unique_words Method
#
#     Create a method called unique_words().
#     Split the text into a list of words.
#     Use a set to store unique words.
#     Return the unique words as a list.
#
#
# Part II: Analyzing Text from a File
#
# Step 5: Implement from_file Class Method
#
#     Create a class method called from_file(file_path).
#     Open the file at file_path in read mode.
#     Read the file content.
#     Create and return a Text instance with the file content as the text.
#
#
# Bonus: Text Modification
#
# Step 6: Create the TextModification Class
#
#     Create a class called TextModification that inherits from Text.
#
#
# Step 7: Implement remove_punctuation Method
#
#     Create a method called remove_punctuation().
#     Use the string module to get a string of punctuation characters.
#     Use a string method or regular expressions to remove punctuation from the text attribute.
#     Return the modified text.
#
#
# Step 8: Implement remove_stop_words Method
#
#     Create a method called remove_stop_words().
#     Search online for a list of English stop words (common words like “a”, “the”, “is”).
#     Split the text into a list of words.
#     Filter out stop words from the list.
#     Join the remaining words back into a string.
#     Return the modified text.
#
#
# Step 9: Implement remove_special_characters Method
#
#     Create a method called remove_special_characters().
#     Use regular expressions to remove special characters from the text attribute.
#     Return the modified text.
