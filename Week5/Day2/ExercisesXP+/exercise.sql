/*
    Create a database called bootcamp.
    Create a table called students.
    Add the following columns:
        id
        last_name
        first_name
        birth_date
        The id must be auto_incremented.
        Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
        To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)


Here is the data:
id 	first_name 	last_name 	birth_date
1 	Marc 	Benichou 	02/11/1998
2 	Yoan 	Cohen 	03/12/2010
3 	Lea 	Benichou 	27/07/1987
4 	Amelia 	Dux 	07/04/1996
5 	David 	Grez 	14/06/2003
6 	Omer 	Simpson 	03/10/1980
