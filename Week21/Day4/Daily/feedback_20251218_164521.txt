suggestions for improvement:
- The `Library` class's `books` property should be initialized in the constructor.
- The `DigitalLibrary` class's `website` property should be initialized in the constructor.
- Consider using a more descriptive return type for `getBookDetails` (e.g., `Book | string`) instead of relying on string concatenation and returning 'Book Not Found' as a string.  This could be improved by returning a `Book` object or `undefined`.
- The `addBook` method in the Library class should probably also accept an ISBN to prevent adding duplicate books.
- The `DigitalLibrary` should call the super constructor when it is instantiated.
