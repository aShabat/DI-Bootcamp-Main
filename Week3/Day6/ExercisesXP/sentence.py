# Step 1: Create the get_words_from_file function
#
#     Create a function named get_words_from_file that takes the file path as an argument.
#     Open the file in read mode ("r").
#     Read the file content.
#     Split the content into a list of words.
#     Return the list of words.
#
#
# Step 2: Create the get_random_sentence function
#
#     Create a function named get_random_sentence that takes the sentence length as an argument.
#     Call get_words_from_file to get the list of words.
#     Select a random word from the list length times.
#     Create a sentence with the selected words.
#     Convert the sentence to lowercase.
#     Return the sentence.
#
#
# Step 3: Create the main function
#
#     Create a function named main.
#     Print a message explaining the programâ€™s purpose.
#     Ask the user for the desired sentence length.
#     Validate the user input:
#         Check if it is an integer.
#         Check if it is between 2 and 20 (inclusive).
#     If the input is invalid, print an error message and exit.
#     If the input is valid, call get_random_sentence with the length and print the generated sentence.
