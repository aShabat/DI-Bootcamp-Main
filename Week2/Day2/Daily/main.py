# Step 1: Transforming the String into a 2D List
#
#
# Step 2: Processing Columns
#
#     Neo reads the matrix column by column, from top to bottom, starting from the leftmost column.
#     Youâ€™ll need to write code that iterates through the columns of your 2D list.
#     Think about how you can access the elements of a 2D list by column.
#
#
# Step 3: Filtering Alpha Characters
#
#     only select alpha characters (letters).
#     For each character in a column, check if itâ€™s an alpha character.
#     If it is, add it to a temporary string.
#     Think about how you can check if a character is an alphabet letter.
#
#
# Step 4: Replacing Symbols with Spaces
#
#     Replace every group of symbols (non-alpha characters) between two alpha characters with a space.
#     After you have gathered the alpha characters, you will need to iterate through them, and where there are non alpha characters between them, you will insert a space.
#     Think about how you can keep track of when you encounter an alphabet character, and when you encounter a non alphabet character.
#
#
# Step 5: Constructing the Secret Message
#
#     Combine the filtered and processed characters to form the decoded message.
#     Print the decoded message.
